You have built a deep-learning based invisible image watermarking system that hides a watermark securely inside a host image and later recovers it, providing high robustness and imperceptibility compared to traditional watermarking techniques.

🚀 Advantages (Short & Crisp)

✔ Invisible watermark — no visual distortion to original image

✔ Robust against compression, noise & edits

✔ Uses learned features (DL) → harder to remove or attack

✔ Works automatically without hand-crafted rules

✔ Supports high-quality recovery using encoder-decoder design

🔍 How it differs from Classical Watermarking
Traditional Watermarking	Your Deep Learning Watermarking
Hand-crafted transforms (DCT, DWT)	AI learns best hiding + extraction strategy
Easy to detect/remove	Harder to attack/wipe watermark
Poor robustness under compression	Designed to resist distortions (JPEG, noise etc.)
Limited adaptation	Automatically improves with more training
